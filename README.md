## Welcome! ðŸ‘½

This project is the implementation of an interactive rating component as part of a challenge proposed by Frontend Mentor. The component allows users to rate a service and provide feedback about their experience. With a modern design and an intuitive user experience, the component offers a simple and effective way to collect ratings. The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and advanced front-end techniques to create an elegant and functional solution. It's a great opportunity to enhance my development skills and learn more about creating interactive components.
